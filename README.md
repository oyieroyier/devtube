# DevTube

## Description

DevTube is a minimalist website made for Developers that that allows users to watch YouTube tutorials and code within the site using the embedded Compiler.

## User Story

- A DevTube user can:
  1.  Sign Up for an account (or Sign In if they are a returning user)
  2.  Search for a YouTube video on the site.
  3.  Watch the YouTube video on the site.
  4.  Code on the site using a provided compiler API.

## Project Setup

This project has been handled using JavaScript programming langage, Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

In order to use the content on this repository ensure you have the following:

- A computer running on either Windows 7+, Linux or Mac OS.

- Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any Chromium-based browser.

## Running application

- Click on the live link [HERE](https://tubedev.netlify.app/) to launch the site with your browser.
<br>
- The link takes you to a dummy DevTube authentication page.
  Try out the different options by clicking on either **Sign Up** or **Login Here**.
  Refresh the page if you want to try out the other button.
  <br>
- Upon signing up/in, the application takes you to the landing page with a welcome message and a brief introduction to what DevTube is about.<br> <br>
- Search any video (preferably a coding tutorial ðŸ˜‰) in the search bar.<br> <br>
- From the results (*I have currently capped the maximum results at 5 to avoid quickly depleting the daily quota of calls to the YouTube API*), click on the video you want to watch. <br> <br>
- Clicking on a video loads the IDE/Compiler at the bottom of the page.<br> <br>
- On the IDE, click on the button showing **Python 3.x(python 3.9.5)** and select the language your tutorial is in and start coding in the IDE.<br> <br>
- The Standard Output of your code will be displayed on the right of the IDE.
I recommend users clicking on the *clear output on each new submission* option at the bottom of the StdOut console.
